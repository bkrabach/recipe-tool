## Goal

Create a new JSON recipe file for creating new JSON recipe files, named `create_recipe_json.json`.

## How

### Input context variables

- `input`: [Required] The file path to a recipe idea file.
- `files`: [Optional] A list of additional files to include in the recipe.
- `model`: [Optional] The model to use for generating the recipe. Defaults to `openai/o3-mini`.
- `output_root`: [Optional] The root directory for saving the generated recipe file. Defaults to `output`.
- `target_file`: [Optional] The name of the file to save the generated recipe to. Defaults to `generated_recipe.json` unless the recipe idea suggests a different name.

### Steps

1. Start with read of the recipe idea file (`input` context variable).

2. Always load the following files into context as `context_files`:

- `ai_context/generated/recipe_executor_code_files.md`
- `ai_context/generated/recipe_executor_recipe_files.md`

3. Load any other files that are passed in via the `files` context variable. These files should be considered optional and stored in a variable called `additional_files`.

4. Use the LLM (default set to use `openai/o3-mini`) to generate the content for a JSON recipe file:

```markdown
Create a new JSON recipe file for use with recipe executor based on the following content:

- Recipe Idea: {{recipe_idea}}
- Context Files:
  <CONTEXT_FILES>{{context_files}}</CONTEXT_FILES>
  {% if additional_files %}
- Additional Files:
  <ADDITIONAL_FILES>{{additional_files}}</ADDITIONAL_FILES>
  {% endif %}

Save the generated recipe file as `generated_recipe.json` unless a different name is specified in the recipe idea.
```

5. Save the generated file.

- The root should be set to value of `output_root` context variable, or `output` if not specified.
