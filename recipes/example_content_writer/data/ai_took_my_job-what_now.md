# [AI Took My Job — What Now?!](https://medium.com/@paradox921/ai-took-my-job-what-now-d08132c8f1ad)

Imagine spending months hand‑crafting a bespoke mechanical watch, only to wake up and find an automated manufacturing line has produced an indistinguishable copy overnight. That’s how it felt when an **AI system** took over the work I’d spent decades mastering. One day I was the craftsman with a rare skill and passion; the next, a cold algorithmic workflow replicated my output in a fraction of the time. I sat there, stunned. Did that really happen? My stomach dropped as confusion turned into panic. This wasn’t just losing a job — it felt like losing a piece of myself.

To be clear, I’m not unemployed. But I’m no longer doing the job I’ve done for decades. As a software engineer I’m not writing code every day — and I’m not sure there’s a place for me to keep doing so professionally, going forward.

> **The work hasn’t vanished, but the gate has swung open.** We still need high‑quality code; it’s simply becoming something anyone can generate with the right prompts. My value can’t hinge on access to the keyboard alone. It has to uplevel.

My story isn’t unique. The disruption that **AI technology** is bringing to software engineering mirrors what countless trades have faced when their lifelong skills were displaced by new inventions or made so accessible there was no longer a premium market for them.

# Fear of Obsolescence

Once the shock wore off, fear crept in.

If a machine could do in minutes what took me years to master, what did that say about my future? I felt like a wagon maker in the age of the automobile, a blacksmith watching an assembly line churn out steel horseshoes faster than I could hammer one. I had always taken pride in the intuition and craft I poured into every project. But now? I wasn’t sure those human touches mattered.

In the quiet moments I asked myself:

- Are my skills becoming obsolete?
- Is any part of what I do *not* replicable by code and silicon?

# This Isn’t New… But It Still Hit Hard

The latest tipping point came when OpenAI released a new Codex coding agent. I had recently worked on a project that automates software development using **AI tools** — a tool I was proud of, built over days and already accelerated by earlier automation. Curious, I asked Codex to try the same task. It did — *in minutes* — producing a passable version with tests and iterations. Suddenly I questioned whether I should even finish the new work I’d started.

I’ve felt that sting every few weeks for the past few years. My role puts me on the front lines of this wave — or, as my boss calls it, “running in front of the avalanche.” The very systems I help build inevitably make yesterday’s work unnecessary.

Every new breakthrough article, every clever demo, every excited conversation about what **AI tech** can do next is exhilarating. But it also feels like watching the horizon close in on what used to be mine. Projects that once needed a team — or at least me — now need a single person with the right **AI stack**. They don’t even need to be a software engineer.

# Reflection

After enough of those nights — the anxious ones followed by uncertain mornings — I realized I needed to step back and figure out what really mattered. I also thought about the broader impact, especially with my kids finishing college and stepping into careers certain to collide with the same disruption.

As I pondered, a subtle shift began. I remembered why I fell in love with coding in the first place. It wasn’t the routine tasks or job security; it was creating something from nothing, solving problems in inventive ways, and helping people through that work.

It was always about *what* I built and *who* it helped. That spark — my *why* — was still there, just buried under fear. Even if the *way* I worked was changing, the *goal* could stay the same. Ironically, the routine tasks I can offload to **AI tools** were what had been holding me back from spending more time doing the parts I loved. As someone close to me observed, when I don’t lean on automation, *I* become the bottleneck to my own creativity.

I have access to super‑powers I’ve never had before — **we all do**.

# A Familiar Pattern in History

Every generation faces a moment when a previously scarce skill becomes abundant:

- **Scribes → Printing Press**: Hand‑copied manuscripts gave way to mass‑produced books, freeing writers to reach orders of magnitude more readers.
- **Darkroom Photographers → Digital Cameras**: Mastery of chemicals and film stock became optional; storytelling through images exploded.
- **Gate‑kept Music Production → Home Studios**: What once required a record‑label budget now fits on a laptop, unleashing independent artists.
- **Accounting Ledgers → Spreadsheets**: Bean‑counting automated, while financial analysis and strategy ballooned.

Craftsmanship didn’t disappear in any of these shifts; it evolved. The same thing is happening with software development today.

# Reframing the Future

With that lens I stopped seeing automation as a threat and started treating it as raw material — powerful, but shapeable. The question shifted from *What have I lost?* to *What can I do now that I couldn’t before?*

I thought back to childhood evenings spent building wild spaceships from LEGO bricks. The pieces were just the medium; the magic was in the vision. **AI systems** started to feel like an enormous pile of self‑assembling bricks that still needs a human architect.

Then another realization hit me:

**This change isn’t coming — it has already happened.**

I haven’t written code by hand in more than two months. I feed ideas, specs, and goals into automation that generates what I need — blueprints and all. I’m tackling bigger ideas, faster, with less friction than ever before.

And I almost missed it happening. I’ve been having the time of my life, bringing more ideas to reality at a velocity I’ve never experienced.

I’ve moved from laying every brick myself to sketching the blueprints of entire structures — structures **AI tools** bring to life.

My craftsmanship shifted too. Offloading quality coding to automation frees me to obsess over the user experience. I spend less time per feature **_and more_** time testing it with a user’s eyes, iterating toward the *right* experience. Somehow, it still has my fingerprints all over it — in fact, in ways that are more visible than ever!

# Rediscovering My Why

This journey — from panic to possibility — brought me back to the core: the joy of creation, the thrill of solving something hard, the satisfaction of building work that matters.

**AI technology** didn’t extinguish that spark; it reignited it.

I don’t fixate on the tasks automation does better. I focus on what only I can do — vision, empathy, creative leaps. Those human elements sit in the center of my work again.

Fear still shows up, but it doesn’t stay long. The machine might produce the watch, but it can’t *dream* it up. It doesn’t get chills when the idea lands. It doesn’t have a why. It’s just a tool.

# Not Just My Story

I’m watching this play out everywhere:

- Product‑managers once blocked for months waiting for engineering resources are iterating on full prototypes before getting to that point.
- Solo entrepreneurs spin up cloud backends, analytics pipelines, and marketing sites, scaling their ideas from scratch.
- Data analysts use natural‑language SQL helpers to surface insights without being required to write programming-like queries.
- Teachers craft interactive lesson plans, complete with quizzes and graphics, in an afternoon.
- Designers co‑create concepts with generative imagery, then focus on nuance and brand.
- Friends in mid‑career switch tracks entirely, leveraging **AI tech** to cross skill gaps that once felt like walls.

# Practical Ways to Lean In (Right Now)

1.  **Uplevel Your Thinking First**: Let automation handle the mechanical steps — drafting prose, crunching numbers, laying out designs — so you can invest brainpower in strategy, creativity, and impact.
2.  **Prototype at Whiteboard Speed**: Ask AI tools for first‑pass drafts — concept sketches, schedules, or marketing pitches — then use your expertise to pressure‑test and refine.
3.  **Direct, Don’t Dictate**: Treat the tools like an eager apprentice — delegate repetitive chores, inspect its output for fit, and coach it with context only you possess.
4.  **Deepen Your Domain Mojo**: Whether you’re in finance, healthcare, art, or carpentry, the sharper your subject knowledge, the more transformative your automation‑powered solutions become.
5.  **Invest Saved Time in Human Value**: Pour reclaimed hours into client conversations, storytelling, mentorship, and bold experiments — the uniquely human work machines can’t replicate.

# What About You?

What’s been locked up for you?What could you create if the friction disappeared?What dream have you shelved that **AI super‑powers** might help revive?

You don’t have to have it all figured out. Your *real* job might be waiting on the other side of that first spark of curiosity.

It’s still uniquely human. Still uniquely yours.Still bursting with potential.
