My day job at Microsoft is to lead an innovation team centered on exploring the cutting edge of AI and making it more accessible for the benefit of everyone. I also have ADHD, which brings some significant advantages in this space as well as many challenges.

Here are some insights that didn't come about from a planned experiment. They emerged organically - as I navigated my own challenges with ADHD and observed the experiences of friends and colleagues in the community. Use of AI assistance here isn't meant to "fix" us; rather, it offers a way to leverage today's tools for safe, patient, always-on thinking, processing, and learning that adapts to our naturally diverse ways of thinking.

This is a collection of examples, drawn from my own experiences, that illustrate how AI can help us work with our "neurodivergent" brains instead of against them. While these tips stem from my personal journey, many of them apply more broadly as well.

## How I Use AI for Assistance

**Thinking Out Loud, Safely:**  
I process verbally. With AI, I can freely dump raw, mid-process thoughts without fear of misunderstanding or judgment. It helps me clarify my ideas faster and turn them into something structured and shareable.

**From Chaos to Clarity:**  
Whether it's from long voice sessions or typed notes, I can offload everything and later ask the AI to organize, distill, and clean it up without losing my voice.

**Different Formats for Different Audiences:**  
I can repurpose these raw interactions into "lightweight" versions - be it an outline, a summary, or a metaphor-rich narrative - tailoring the information to fit the needs and preferences of my audience.

**Digesting Heavy Material, My Way:**  
Long, dense documents can be overwhelming. I break them down into bite-sized pieces or have them restructured into story, metaphor, or Q&A formats - whichever helps me process and retain the info.

**Context-Carrying for Multitasking:**  
I bounce between topics constantly. AI can keep track of my context so I can jump back in later without missing a beat.

**Capturing Fast-Moving Thoughts:**  
I can chase multiple ideas at once, and the AI helps organize, label, and recover any useful insights - so I don't have to keep track manually.

**Accelerated Creative Breakthroughs:**  
I frequently compress a week's worth of "aha moments" into an afternoon by bouncing ideas around with the assistant.

**Leveraging Misinterpretation for Insight:**  
The AI sometimes misunderstands me, and that sparks new ideas. This feedback loop becomes a creative asset.

**Preprocessing for Human Interactions:**  
I now show up to team discussions or presentations more prepared and clearer - saving time and reducing confusion.

**Practicing Effective Dialogue Habits:**  
Having to speak in bursts - especially when technical hiccups lose the message, and it is hard for me to repeat a long, rambling message - led to discovering the value of more bi-directional exchange and has taught me to communicate in shorter, clearer, and more interactive exchanges with others.

**Learning Better Phrasing by Example:**  
I often ask the AI to rework rough drafts or emotional reactions into cleaner, more effective responses - and I've learned a lot from how it does that.

## Learnings from Others Around Me

The examples above, though drawn from my personal experience, resonate with many individuals navigating ADHD. Here are some generalized insights I've seen work for others - and that I'm learning from as well:

**Rebuilding Confidence:**  
Many of us have struggled with feeling misunderstood - sometimes even at the cost of relationships or opportunities. Using these tools enables us to engage more effectively, be heard, and be understood. It can be genuinely life-changing.

**Sharpening Communication Instincts:**  
By observing how the AI organizes and reframes input, you learn which parts of your message truly matter. This ongoing feedback helps you understand what information is essential and how best to present it.

**Refining Ideas Before Sharing:**  
Conversing privately with the AI allows you to test how something lands, adjust based on the response, and walk into conversations feeling more grounded and prepared.

**Turning Overwhelming Tasks into Fast Wins:**  
Tasks that once felt monumental - like compiling a detailed response or drafting important communication - now take minutes with AI support.

**Safe Emotional Offloading:**  
When emotions threaten to derail communication, the can AI provide a clear outlet to vent and later refine those raw thoughts into balanced, thoughtful expressions.

**Reducing Reactivity, Increasing Clarity:**  
The AI can act as a buffer, helping you reflect and respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively.

## A New Chapter in Communication

These aren't just improvements in productivity - they're steps toward reclaiming control over how we think and communicate. AI assistance doesn't replace human interaction or magically produce the perfect response; it becomes a flexible tool that adapts to our strengths and fills in the gaps caused by ADHD. The evolution of these interactions can enhance creativity and insight while building a more confident, clear, and authentic way of being heard.

I hope these insights spark further exploration and conversation. Based on feedback that these learnings are helpful to others, I'll continue sharing new discoveries on how these tools are transforming not just the work we do, but the way we live and connect.
