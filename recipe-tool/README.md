# Recipe Tool

Recipe Tool is a wrapper around two main components: the Recipe Executor and the Recipe Creator. It is designed to help you automate tasks and generate new recipes using a flexible orchestration system.

### Recipe Executor

The Recipe Executor is a tool for executing recipes defined in JSON format. It can perform various tasks, including file reading/writing, LLM generation, and sub-recipe execution. The executor uses a context system to manage shared state and data between steps.

### Recipe Creator

The Recipe Creator is a tool for generating new recipes based on a recipe idea. It uses the Recipe Executor to create JSON recipe files that can be executed later. The creator can also take additional files as input to provide context for the recipe generation.

## Using the Makefile

The project includes several useful make commands:

- **`make`**: Sets up the virtual environment and installs all dependencies

## Running Recipes via Command Line

Execute a recipe using the command line interface:

```bash
recipe-tool --execute path/to/your/recipe.json
```

You can also pass context variables:

```bash
recipe-tool --execute path/to/your/recipe.json context_key=value context_key2=value2
```

Example:

```bash
recipe-tool --execute recipes/example_simple/test_recipe.json model=azure/o4-mini
```

## Creating New Recipes from a Recipe Idea

Create a new recipe using the command line interface:

```bash
recipe-tool --create path/to/your/recipe_idea.txt
```

This will generate a new recipe file based on the provided idea.
You can also pass additional files for context:

```bash
recipe-tool --create path/to/your/recipe_idea.txt \
   files=path/to/other_file.txt,path/to/another_file.txt
```

Example:

```bash
recipe-tool --create recipes/recipe_creator/prompts/sample_recipe_idea.md

# Test it out
recipe-tool --execute output/analyze_codebase.json \
   input=ai_context/generated/RECIPE_EXECUTOR_CODE_FILES.md,ai_context/generated/RECIPE_EXECUTOR_BLUEPRINT_FILES.md
```
