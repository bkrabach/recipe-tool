# Recipe Executor

A tool for executing recipe-like natural language instructions to create complex workflows. This project includes a recipe
The Recipe Executor is a tool for executing recipes defined in JSON format. It can perform various tasks, including file reading/writing, LLM generation, and sub-recipe execution. The executor uses a context system to manage shared state and data between steps.

**NOTE**: The code in this directory is 100% generated by the Recipe Executor itself, using the [codebase-generator](../recipes/codebase_generator/) recipe. The `codebase-generator` recipes use the [Recipe Executor Blueprints](../blueprints/recipe-executor/) to define the components, their contracts (docs), and requirements (spec). Do not modify the code in this directory directly. Instead, modify the blueprints and regenerate the code using the `codebase-generator` recipe.
