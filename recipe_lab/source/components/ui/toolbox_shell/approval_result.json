  "notes": "Strengths:\n- All required spec sections are present (title, purpose, core requirements, implementation considerations, dependencies, files, logging, error handling, integration considerations).\n- Requirements are specific, verifiable, and focused on the “what.”\n- Implementation guidance is appropriately detailed for a JS UI component (moderate level).\n- Dependencies, output files, and error cases are clearly enumerated.\n\nMinor suggestions:\n- Explicitly mark empty configuration dependencies as “None” to align with the guide’s pattern.\n- Consider adding an Error‐level logging subsection (e.g., logging errors during import/export failures).\n- Document the shape and defaults of the optional `options` parameter (CSS prefix, filenames, logger) in either the spec or a companion doc.\n- Optionally clarify ARIA role/attribute expectations (e.g., role=“list” for palette, aria-grabbed state for drag-and-drop).\n\nWith those tweaks, this JSON spec is comprehensive enough to generate both a markdown spec and matching documentation later."
