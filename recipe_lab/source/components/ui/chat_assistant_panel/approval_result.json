  "notes": "The JSON spec already hits all of the major sections required by our spec‐guide (title, purpose, core requirements, implementation considerations, dependencies, output files, logging, error handling, integration hints). It’s a solid foundation that can be transformed into a docs/spec split. \n\nA few minor gaps & questions before finalizing:\n\n1. Configuration Dependencies Detail:\n   • The spec lists LLM_API_ENDPOINT & LLM_API_KEY but does not describe each (required vs optional, format, defaults). Our guide expects bullet descriptions under \"Configuration Dependencies\".  \n\n2. Public Events API:\n   • You expose an `on(event, callback)` hook, but you haven’t enumerated which event names are supported (e.g. \"sent\", \"response\", \"error\", \"nodeInsert\", \"stream\").  \n\n3. Debounce Interval vs. No Debounce:\n   • The config schema includes `debounceInterval?`, but implementation notes say “do not implement a fixed time debounce window.” How should `debounceInterval` be used? \n\n4. Logging Levels:\n   • You specify debug/info messages but no error‐level log entries. Should network/invalid response failures be logged at error? \n\nOnce those points are clarified (and the config var descriptions added), you’ll have a fully comprehensive spec ready for split into docs (public API, examples, usage) and implementation spec (internal guidance, logging formats, error strategies)."
