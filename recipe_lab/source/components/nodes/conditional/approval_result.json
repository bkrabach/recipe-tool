  "notes": "The spec includes all required sections (title, purpose, core requirements, implementation considerations, dependencies, output files, logging, error handling, integration considerations), with specific, verifiable requirements and clear separation of concerns. It’s ready to be converted into markdown docs/spec pair. \n\nMinor enhancements you may consider before finalizing:\n- In component_dependencies, explicitly describe why Drawflow is required (e.g., “Uses Drawflow’s editor.registerNode API”).\n- Optionally include an explicit ‘Error’ subsection under logging (or state “None”) for completeness.\n- You might also include a note on Drawflow version compatibility in docs dependencies if needed.  \n\nOverall, it’s comprehensive and aligned with the spec guide."
