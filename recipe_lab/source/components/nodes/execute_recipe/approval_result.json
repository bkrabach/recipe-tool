  "notes": "The spec includes all required sections—Component Title, Purpose Statement, Core Requirements, Implementation Considerations, Component Dependencies, Output Files, Logging Requirements, Error Handling, and Dependency Integration Considerations—and provides actionable, verifiable requirements aligned with the guide. It’s sufficiently detailed for conversion into full docs and a spec file. \n\nMinor improvements for maximum clarity before conversion:\n- Explicitly mark empty categories (external libraries, configuration dependencies) as None.\n- Consider adding error-level log entries for JSON parse failures alongside the existing debug and info logs.\n- Choose a consistent implementation section header (e.g., “Implementation Details” vs. “Implementation Considerations”) to match project conventions.\n\nWith those tweaks, the spec is ready for markdown‐based docs and specification files."
