  "notes": "The spec is well-structured and aligns closely with the guide: it includes all required sections (title, purpose, core requirements, implementation considerations, dependencies, output files, logging, and error handling). It provides actionable, verifiable requirements and appropriate implementation guidance for an ES module Drawflow node.\n\nMinor recommendations before final conversion:\n1. Explicitly mark \"Dependency Integration Considerations\" as None rather than an empty array to signal intentional omission.\n2. Expand the logging section to include error-level messages (e.g., for JSON parse failures) to match the promise of console.error usage.\n3. Clarify how the export-blocking should be enforced (e.g., disabling Drawflowâ€™s export button or intercepting export events).\n4. Optionally specify default values for config fields (e.g., default transport type, empty strings for tool_name/result_key) to guide UI initialization.\n\nWith these minor clarifications, the spec is comprehensive enough for conversion into docs/spec markdown."
