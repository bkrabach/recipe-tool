  "notes": "This JSON spec is well‐structured and includes all of the required sections from the guide: title, purpose statement, core requirements, implementation guidance, dependencies, output files, logging, and error handling.  \n\n– All mandatory spec sections are present and sufficiently detailed for code generation.  \n– The implementation considerations strike a good balance between guidance and flexibility.  \n– Dependencies and output files are clearly articulated.  \n– Error conditions and logging requirements are both well-specified.\n\nMinor suggestions for a future pass: explicitly mark truly empty sections (e.g., configuration_dependencies or dependency_integration_considerations) as “None” to match the spec template, and consider adding a brief version-compatibility section if your project tracks semantic versions."
