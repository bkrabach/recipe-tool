  "notes": "The refined spec is well-structured and includes all required sections (Title, Purpose, Core Requirements, Implementation Considerations, Dependencies, Output Files, Logging, Error Handling, Integration Considerations). It’s sufficiently detailed for conversion to both a documentation file and a specification file. A couple of minor polish points:\n\n• Core Requirements currently mix in some HTML/CSS implementation detail (df-* attributes, specific class names). You may wish to move those into Implementation Considerations to keep the “what” vs. “how” distinction clearer.\n• The Logging section covers debug/info levels; consider whether any error-level log messages should be listed here or referenced under Error Handling.\n\nOtherwise, this spec aligns cleanly with the Component Docs & Spec Guide."
