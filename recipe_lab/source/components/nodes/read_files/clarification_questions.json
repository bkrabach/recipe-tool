  "Should the file path input support multiple paths? If so, how should multiple paths be represented in the UI and stored in node.data.config.path (e.g., comma-separated string)?",
  "In the HTML template, are there any accessibility or structural requirements for <label> elements and input id attributes (for example, should each <input> have a corresponding <label for=\"â€¦\"> and an id)?",
  "Should we define default initial values for node.data.config.path and node.data.config.content_key when a node is first created (for example, empty strings), or assume the client will supply initial config?",
  "The spec refers to <input> elements marked with df-path and df-content_key attributes. Should these be custom attributes (df-path, df-content_key) or HTML5 data attributes (data-df-path, data-df-content_key) to align with Drawflow conventions?",
  "What, if any, validation or user feedback should be implemented when the user provides invalid or empty values for the path or content key inputs? Should the UI display errors or simply accept and store the values?",
  "Although the candidate spec lists no logging requirements, should the implementation include any console.debug or console.info calls during node creation or config updates?",
  "For the ES module at src/nodes/read_files.js, do you prefer a named export (export function registerReadFiles) or a default export?",
  "Does the editor.registerNode call need any additional configuration properties (such as title, class, inputs/outputs metadata) beyond html and onCreate, or should it be strictly limited to those two?",
  "For the documentation deliverable, what should be the file path and file name (e.g., docs/nodes/read_files.md), and which high-level sections must it include (for instance, import instructions, Drawflow integration example, recipe JSON example)?",
  "Are any automated tests required for this Read Files Node component? If so, where should the test files live and which scenarios (e.g., default values, config updates, serialization) must they cover?",
  "In the Component Dependencies section, could you provide a brief description of how the external library 'drawflow' is used (for example, minimum version and which Drawflow APIs are leveraged)?"
