  "notes": "The refined spec is comprehensive and aligns well with the guide. It includes all required sections: title, purpose, core requirements, implementation considerations, dependencies, output files, logging, error handling, and integration notes. A few minor suggestions before converting to markdown:\n\n• Empty sections (e.g., info-level logging, configuration dependencies, error handling) should be explicitly marked “None” to signal intentional omission.\n• In Component Dependencies, use descriptive entries (e.g., specify “drawflow (>=0.4.0) — for node registration and data binding”) rather than raw strings.\n• Consider adding a brief error-handling note (even if “None”), or outline how to handle invalid paths/input parsing if desired.\n\nWith those small tweaks, you can confidently generate the docs and spec pair in the next step."
