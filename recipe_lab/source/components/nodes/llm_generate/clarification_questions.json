  "What is the exact public API signature and import path for registerLLMGenerate that should be documented? (e.g. `import { registerLLMGenerate } from 'src/nodes/llm_generate.js'`)",
  "Can you confirm the precise data types, valid value ranges, and allowed options for each config field: prompt (string), model (string), max_tokens (integer), mcp_servers (JSON/string/array), output_format (enum?), and output_key (string)?",
  "What are the default values for every config property (prompt, model, max_tokens, mcp_servers, output_format, output_key)? The spec mentions some defaults but not all.",
  "For the mcp_servers field, should the UI present raw JSON in a <textarea> or a structured form? What default JSON schema or example value should be shown?",
  "What labels, placeholder texts, and ordering should each form control (prompt, model, etc.) have in the configuration UI?",
  "What are the names, types, and labels of the input and output ports on the node? Are there any conventions for port naming or data typing?",
  "How should validation errors be displayed in the UI? Please describe the messaging style, element highlighting, and whether node saving should be blocked on errors.",
  "Should the specification explicitly mark the \"Configuration Dependencies\" and \"Info\" logging sections as \"None\" (per the style guide), or do you expect to add entries there?",
  "Which logging mechanism should we use (console.log, a logger instance, etc.), and what exact message format should be used for the debug logs on node creation and config updates?",
  "Are there any CSS classes or styling guidelines we should apply to the HTML form to satisfy the minimal wabi-sabi/KISS principles?",
  "Would you like us to include a code example in the documentation showing how to initialize the Drawflow editor and call registerLLMGenerate? If so, please provide a sample snippet.",
  "Are there any environment variables or external configuration overrides for the default model, max_tokens, or other fields that need to be documented?",
  "Can you share the exact schema mapping between node.data.config keys and the LLMGenerateStep config schema (including any field name differences)?",
  "Should we include version compatibility or semantic versioning notes for this component in the spec or docs?",
  "Beyond alignment with serialization.js and the LLMGenerateStep schema, are there any additional integration considerations or cross-component dependencies to document?"
