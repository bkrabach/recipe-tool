  "approved": true,
  "notes": "The spec is well‐structured and includes all required sections (title, purpose, core requirements, implementation considerations, dependencies, output files, logging, error handling, integration considerations). The requirements are specific and verifiable, implementation guidance is at the right level of detail, and dependency lists are clear. You may consider two minor refinements before conversion:\n\n1. Purpose Statement: It currently blends a bit of implementation detail. Splitting it into two concise sentences that focus on ‘what’ and ‘why’ (leaving the ‘how’ to the spec) would align even more closely with the guide’s recommendation.\n2. Empty categories (internal_components and configuration_dependencies) could explicitly be marked as “None” (or an explicit note) rather than empty arrays to match the guide’s “None if absent” convention.\n\nWith these tweaks, the JSON payload is comprehensive and ready for translation into a full docs/spec pair."
