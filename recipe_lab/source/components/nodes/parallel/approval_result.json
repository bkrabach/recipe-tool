  "approved": true,
  "notes": "The spec is largely complete and aligns well with the Component Docs/Spec Guide—it includes all required sections (title, purpose, core requirements, implementation considerations, dependencies, output files, logging, and error handling). A few minor enhancements would make it rock-solid:\n\n• Logging: Add a warning-level entry (e.g., “Invalid JSON in Substeps field”) under logging requirements to match the error‐handling recovery action.\n• Dependency Integration: Explicitly mark the empty `dependency_integration_considerations` as None for clarity.\n• Core Requirements: Consider moving the `min=0` HTML constraint (currently in Implementation Considerations) into the Core Requirements to ensure verifiability.\n• Tests: Add an explicit test case for verifying the default config on initial node drag (default substeps, max_concurrency, delay).\n\nWith these tweaks, the JSON payload is fully sufficient to drive both a comprehensive docs file and a matching spec file in a future step."
