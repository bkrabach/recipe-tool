  "What is the intended public API signature and usage pattern for consumers of this component? For example, should the docs show how to import and call `registerParallel(editor)` and provide a complete code snippet?",
  "Could you provide a concrete JSON schema or example structure for the `substeps` field—what properties should each substep object contain, and are there required or optional fields?",
  "What validation rules or value constraints should apply to `max_concurrency` (e.g., must be a non‐negative integer, does 0 mean unlimited) and to `delay` (units, minimum/maximum, float formatting)?",
  "Should we include default styling or layout guidelines (e.g., CSS classes, template width/height) for the node’s HTML form in the specification, or is the node expected to inherit styles from Drawflow?",
  "How exactly should the component handle reverting to the last valid `substeps` value after a JSON parse error? Should there be an internal backup store or undo stack on `node.data.config`?",
  "Beyond showing an alert on JSON parse errors, are there any logging requirements for error or info events (e.g., log a warning when invalid substeps are entered, log when the node is created or updated)?",
  "In the documentation, should we include a section demonstrating integration of the Parallel node into a recipe builder flow or Drawflow canvas with sample UI screenshots or recipe JSON examples?",
  "Which version(s) of the Drawflow library must this component support, and are there any version‐specific considerations (e.g., compatibility notes) we should document?",
  "Where should the documentation file for this component live (e.g., path under a `docs/components/nodes` directory), and what naming conventions should we follow?",
  "Should the specification explicitly mark the `Dependency Integration Considerations` section as None, or are there any subtle interactions with other nodes or recipe‐builder services that need mentioning?",
  "Do we need to specify or generate any automated tests as part of the output (e.g., unit tests for JSON parsing, config binding), and if so, where should those be located?",
  "Should we include guidance in the spec or docs on how to extend or customize the node in future (e.g., adding new form fields, custom validation hooks)?"
