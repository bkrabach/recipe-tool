  "notes": "The spec JSON covers almost all of the required specification sections (title, purpose, core requirements, implementation considerations, dependencies, output files, logging, error handling, integration considerations). It aligns well with the spec‐guide structure and is precise and actionable for implementers.\n\nHowever, to be able to generate *both* a complete spec file *and* the companion user‐facing docs, we should enrich it with:\n\n1. Documentation‐specific content:  \n   • Public API method signatures for `recipeToDrawflow` and `drawflowToRecipe`, including parameter and return‐value descriptions.  \n   • Import instructions (e.g. `import { recipeToDrawflow, drawflowToRecipe } from 'src/modules/serialization'`).  \n   • Basic usage examples (sample recipe JSON → Drawflow JSON, and vice versa).  \n   • Integration guidelines showing how to hook this module into the UI import/export buttons.  \n\n2. Logging completeness:  \n   • Add a “warnings” or “error” log level in `logging_requirements` for the `console.warn` message on unknown metadata fields.  \n\n3. Explicit “None” markers or empty placeholders for empty dependency categories (internal/external/config), to signal intentional omission when rendering.  \n\nWith those additions, the JSON would be fully rich to drive both the specification and the user documentation in a single pass."
