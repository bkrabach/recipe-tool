  "notes": "The spec covers all required sections—title, purpose, core requirements, implementation considerations, dependencies (internal, external, config), output files, logging, error handling, and integration considerations—in a structured, unambiguous way. Requirements are specific and verifiable; implementation guidance is focused and appropriately detailed without over‐constraining; dependencies are clearly categorized; and output files are explicit. Logging covers debug and info levels, but you may want to add any necessary error‐level log messages to support troubleshooting. Otherwise, this JSON has sufficient completeness and alignment to turn into a fully fledged docs/spec pair."
