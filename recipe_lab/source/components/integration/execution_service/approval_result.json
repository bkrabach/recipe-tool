  "notes": "The spec is very well-structured and meets the guide’s requirements: it includes all mandatory sections (title, purpose, core requirements, implementation considerations, dependencies, output files, logging, error handling, and integration considerations). Requirements are specific and unambiguous, and the guidance strikes a good balance between prescribing behavior (e.g., error types) and allowing implementation freedom (e.g., using native fetch).\n\nSuggestions for even greater completeness before converting to markdown:\n• Configuration Dependencies: explicitly mark as “None” or add details if the baseUrl can be set via an environment variable.  \n• Default Values: specify defaults like the timeout duration, default headers, and default baseUrl for clarity.  \n• ExecutionResult Shape: briefly enumerate properties (status: number; headers: Headers; data: any | null) in the types file description.  \n• RequestOptions Shape: enumerate its fields (headers, timeout, signal, returnRawResponse, baseUrl, etc.) so the types.js file is fully defined.  \n• Logging Levels: consider adding an “error” level for logging caught errors (optional).\n\nOverall, the spec is comprehensive and ready for conversion into paired markdown docs/spec files."
