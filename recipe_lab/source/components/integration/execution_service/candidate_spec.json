  "purpose_statement": "The Execution Service Integration component provides a simple ES module interface for submitting a recipe flow JSON to the backend execution API. It exposes a single runRecipe function that posts the recipe definition to the configured /api/execute endpoint and returns the execution results for display or further processing.",
  "core_requirements": [
    "Export a runRecipe(flowJson: object) function that returns a Promise",
    "Perform an HTTP POST to the /api/execute endpoint with Content-Type: application/json",
    "Serialize the provided flowJson payload correctly",
    "Handle non-2xx HTTP responses by rejecting the Promise with a descriptive error",
    "Parse and return the JSON response body on success",
    "Gracefully handle network failures and JSON parsing errors"
  ],
  "implementation_considerations": [
    "Use the native fetch API in a browser environment with no additional dependencies",
    "Ensure Content-Type and any required headers can be easily extended (e.g., for auth tokens)",
    "Keep the module as a pure ES module with a single exported function",
    "Optionally support streaming responses in the future by exposing the Response.body ReadableStream",
    "Document and surface errors clearly so calling code can display retry options"
