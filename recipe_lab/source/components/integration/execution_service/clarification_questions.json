  "Should the base URL or endpoint path (/api/execute) be configurable at runtime, and if so, how (e.g., environment variable, module-level configuration, or function parameter)?",
  "Should runRecipe accept optional parameters for custom headers or other fetch options (e.g., authorization tokens, query parameters, timeout), and how should those be passed in its signature?",
  "How are authentication tokens or other security credentials expected to be provided (e.g., via environment variable, injected header, or callback), and which header names/formats should be used?",
  "Do you want to implement custom Error subclasses (NetworkError, HTTPError, ResponseParseError), and if so, what properties or inheritance structure should they expose?",
  "What is the expected JSON schema or TypeScript interface for the execution result returned by the API, and should we include it in the public API docs?",
  "How should logging be handled—should the module accept an injected logger instance (and if so, which interface) or simply use console.log by default?",
  "When the server responds with a 2xx status but no JSON body (e.g., 204 No Content), how should runRecipe behave (resolve with null, empty object, or reject)?",
  "Do we need to support request cancellation (e.g., via AbortController), and if so, how should that be surfaced in the runRecipe API?",
  "Should the module specially handle certain HTTP status codes (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 429 Too Many Requests) or expose retry-after headers to calling code?",
  "Is there a reference schema or set of validation rules for the flowJson payload, and should the module perform any validation before sending?",
  "How should future streaming response support be exposed—should runRecipe return the raw Response or a ReadableStream, or offer a separate method?",
  "Should the module include unit tests, type definitions, or mocks as part of the output files, or is test scaffolding out of scope for this component?",
  "Are there any performance constraints or configurable timeout requirements for API requests that we need to document or implement?",
  "Should additional response metadata (e.g., headers, status code) be returned alongside the parsed JSON result, and if so, in what structure?",
  "Do you expect the module to implement automatic retries on transient failures (e.g., network errors), and if so, how should retry policies be configured?"
