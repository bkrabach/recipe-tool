  "purpose_statement": "Provides a minimal ES module interface for submitting a recipe flow JSON to a backend execution API. Exposes a single runRecipe function that POSTs the recipe to a configurable endpoint, handles request customization (headers, timeout, cancellation), and returns structured execution results or throws descriptive errors.",
  "core_requirements": [
    "Export a runRecipe(flowJson: object, options?: RequestOptions) function that returns a Promise<ExecutionResult>",
    "Perform an HTTP POST to a configurable endpoint (default \"/api/execute\") with Content-Type: application/json",
    "Serialize the provided flowJson payload correctly",
    "Accept optional parameters for custom headers, AbortSignal, timeout, and additional fetch options",
    "Handle non-2xx HTTP responses by rejecting the Promise with an HTTPError containing status and statusText",
    "Parse and return the JSON response body on success, resolving with an ExecutionResult containing status, headers, and data",
    "Resolve with null data when the server responds with 204 No Content",
    "Gracefully handle network failures by rejecting with NetworkError",
    "Gracefully handle JSON parsing failures by rejecting with ResponseParseError",
    "Support request cancellation via AbortSignal"

    "Use the native fetch API in a browser environment with no additional dependencies",
    "Allow the endpoint URL (baseUrl) to be configured via module-level setter or passed in options",
    "Merge default headers with options.headers, supporting extension for authentication tokens",
    "Wrap fetch in a timeout helper that rejects with TimeoutError after the specified timeout",
    "Accept an AbortSignal in options to allow request cancellation",
    "Provide an optional returnRawResponse flag in options to expose the raw Response or its ReadableStream for future streaming support",
    "Log via console by default; allow injection of a custom logger instance through module configuration or options",
    "Keep the module as a pure ES module with a single exported runRecipe function"
