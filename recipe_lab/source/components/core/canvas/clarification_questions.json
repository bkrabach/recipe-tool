  "Should the createCanvas function be exported as a named export or as the default export, and do we need accompanying TypeScript declaration files or JSDoc type annotations?",
  "Do we need to specify a minimum or exact version range for the \"drawflow\" NPM package to guarantee compatibility?",
  "Is importing Drawflow’s CSS (e.g., \"drawflow/dist/style.css\") part of this module’s responsibility, or will styling be handled elsewhere?",
  "Beyond checking that containerEl instanceof HTMLElement, must we also verify that it is attached to the DOM (for example, using document.contains)?",
  "In the event that importing Drawflow or calling editor.start() fails, should createCanvas rethrow the error, return null, or follow another standard error-recovery approach?",
  "What logging mechanism should the module use to emit the required debug and info messages (console, a provided logger, or a custom logging utility)?",
  "Should createCanvas clear existing child nodes in containerEl before initializing the Drawflow canvas, or should it leave any existing content intact?",
  "Are there any default configuration options (such as grid settings, zoom level, or background) that the module should apply to the Drawflow editor before or immediately after calling editor.start()?",
  "Should the returned Drawflow editor instance be given explicit type information (via TypeScript or JSDoc), and what type signature should be documented for consumers?",
  "Will this module run exclusively in a browser environment, or do we need to accommodate server-side or headless initialization contexts?",
  "Do we need to include guidance in the consumer documentation about how to perform further Drawflow configuration (adding nodes, events, etc.), or is that outside the scope of this component’s docs?",
  "If supporting older browsers requires polyfills or additional setup, should those requirements be documented in this spec or deferred to a separate compatibility guide?"
