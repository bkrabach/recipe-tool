  "notes": "The spec is well-structured and includes all required sections (purpose, core requirements, implementation considerations, dependencies, output files, logging, error handling, and dependency integration). It uses consistent terminology and provides verifiable requirements. \n\nMinor gaps to address before conversion to markdown:\n- Add an explicit error handling entry for the browser-only check (absence of window/document).\n- Specify required error-level logging messages (e.g., when catching import/instantiation failures).\n\nWith those tweaks, the JSON is comprehensive enough to generate both a clear docs file and a detailed spec file."
